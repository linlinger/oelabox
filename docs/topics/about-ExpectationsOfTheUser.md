# Expectations of The User
Oela Box expects that the end user has a basic understanding of Ansible, Vagrant, Bash, Python and Enterprise Linux. While I have a disdain for the idea of assumed knowledge I cannot teach you everything. I will however try my best to make sure you are able to understand and use Oela Box. 

## Learning Resources
To ensure that you are on the right track and to eliminate the issue of assumed knowledge I am providing you a list of resources that I have used myself. The resources I have linked to I believe go over the most important aspects and tools you will see in Oela Box.
