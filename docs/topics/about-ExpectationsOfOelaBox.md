# Expectations of Oela Box
Oela Box strives to be a high quality, easy to use, well documented development environment for Enterprise Linux. More specifically OpenELA. Lack of documentation is considered a serious bug. If a user has trouble understanding how to use Oela Box or how Oela Box works that is also considered a serious bug. A user should be able to take a glance at the moving parts and be able to immediately understand how they work.
